# stock-analysis


##  Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Steve analyze an entire dataset. In this dataset, he is ale to analyze the entire stock market over a couple of years in matter of seconds.

###  Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


### Summary

#### Advantages of refactoring code
* Refactoring code helps run the code a lot quicker, which is what we have been able to do in this specific example.
* Also, makes the data better easy to read.
* Can be used to encompassed thousands of data point at an extraordinary speed.
* Helps identify bugs in our inital code. For instance, before refactoring I was encountering an "Overflow" error which by refactoring I was able to resolve.

#### Disadvantages of refactoring code
* Refactoring code can be time consuming to set up as we have to make sure all the data is coherent and correct in order to ensure proper running. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
##### Although refactoring takes a lot more time to set initially, once that is completed, the results are very good and helps the code run more efficiently. It is definetely worth the extra work at the beginning to set the code correctly for the future user.
